# freEdu Mobile App

## Motivation

I recently stumbled upon [Apollo at Expo: GraphQL Helps Small Teams Move Fast - Adam Miskiewicz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E398q4HGRBA&list=PLpi1lPB6opQzWZwqnG0YIrWcSS3kH5SR8) talk and was intrigued by GraphQL & Apollo client.

So I decided to learn both of those technologies through building a social app using react native with a full-fledged, production ready backend.

Recently my friend Michael Leung (@MiLeung) created [freEdu.tech](https://freedu.tech/) which is a website for Free Tech Education. Find the source code here: https://github.com/MiLeung/freEDU.tech

Taking inspiration from the website, I decided to created the corresponding mobile app for it. This seemed like the perfect use case for my learning experiment so I decided to see how far I could take it.
